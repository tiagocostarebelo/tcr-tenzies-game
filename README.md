# 10rollzies Game ‚Äì Built with React

A fun dice-rolling game where the goal is to get all dice to show the same value. Freeze the dice you want to keep and roll the rest until you match them all.

Built as part of a React learning journey ‚Äî this project uses modern React concepts such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `localStorage`.

## Features

- Win by holding dice until all values match
- Timer that starts on game load and stops on win
- Roll counter to track how many rolls it took to win
- Best time and roll count saved using `localStorage`
- Confetti animation when you win
- Responsive layout and simple, clean UI

## What I Learned

- Managing React component state with `useState`
- Side effects and timers using `useEffect`
- Persistent mutable values with `useRef`
- Handling conditional rendering and state-based UI logic
- Working with `localStorage` for persisting data across sessions
- Component composition and prop management

## Tech Stack

- React (Functional components + hooks)
- Vite (Development bundler)
- nanoid (Unique ID generation for dice)
- react-confetti (Win animation)
- CSS Modules (Simple global styling)
